  "implementation_notes": "This is the very first feature — greenfield. No existing code to follow.\n\nArchitectural decisions:\n- Use pydantic-settings BaseSettings for config to get automatic env var loading and .env file support\n- Use @lru_cache on get_settings() so the Settings instance is created once and reused\n- CORS_ORIGINS stored as list[str] with a @field_validator to handle comma-separated string from env\n- Database engine created at module level using settings; get_db() is an async generator dependency\n- DeclarativeBase defined in database.py so all future models import Base from one place\n- Health check at /api/v1/health (versioned API prefix from the start)\n- All package directories (models/, schemas/, api/, api/routes/, services/) created with empty __init__.py to enable imports in subsequent features\n- Test infrastructure uses httpx.AsyncClient with ASGITransport for async endpoint testing\n- pytest-asyncio configured with asyncio_mode='auto' so tests don't need explicit markers\n\nKey files:\n- backend/pyproject.toml — project metadata, dependencies, tool config\n- backend/app/config.py — Settings class, get_settings()\n- backend/app/database.py — engine, async_session_factory, Base, get_db()\n- backend/app/main.py — FastAPI app, CORS, health check\n- backend/tests/conftest.py — shared fixtures\n- backend/tests/unit/test_config.py — config tests\n- backend/tests/unit/test_database.py — database module tests\n- backend/tests/unit/test_main.py — app endpoint/CORS tests\n\nRisks:\n- asyncpg requires a running PostgreSQL for real connections; unit tests should mock or use SQLite with aiosqlite\n- pydantic-settings reads from process env, so tests must carefully control env vars (use monkeypatch or explicit construction)\n- mypy strict mode may require explicit type annotations on all functions including fixtures",
